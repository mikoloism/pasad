The **Pāsād** is a tool designed to eliminate digital traces and enhance user privacy, fostering a safer and more confident online experience.

## Why PĀSĀD?

In today's digital age, our online activities are constantly monitored, tracked, and analyzed by various entities, from advertisers to data brokers. This pervasive tracking can lead to a loss of privacy, unwanted targeted ads, and even data breaches. As users, we often have little control over how our information is collected and used.

PĀSĀD was created to address these concerns. We believe that everyone has the right to browse the internet without being followed or profiled. By providing a tool that disrupts tracking methods, PĀSĀD empowers users to take control of their digital privacy.

With PĀSĀD, you can:

- Protect your personal information from being exploited.
- Enjoy a more private and secure online experience.
- Browse the web with confidence, knowing that your digital footprint is minimized.

In a world where privacy is increasingly at risk, PĀSĀD serves as your shield against unwanted surveillance and tracking, allowing you to reclaim your online freedom.

## How It Works

PĀSĀD works by disrupting tracking methods used by `Fingerprint.js` and other web footprint algorithms. We achieve this by randomly altering key identifiers that these algorithms rely on, such as the TimeZone and UserAgent values. Each time you open a new tab, PĀSĀD changes these parameters, making it difficult for websites to create a consistent profile of your online behavior. This randomization effectively confuses tracking systems, enhancing your privacy and allowing you to browse the web with greater confidence.
